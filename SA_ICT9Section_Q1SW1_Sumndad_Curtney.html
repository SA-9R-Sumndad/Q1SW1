	<h1>My Manga/Manhwa/Manhua Collection</h1>

	<p>About last year, I started to collect mangas/manhwas. Now you might be wondering "What is the difference of mangas, manhwas, and manhuas?". Well, let me inform you. Mangas are the root of anime. It is read from right-to-left and top-to-bottom, is black and white, and is Japanese. Manhwa, on the other hand, is the root of some kdramas and hanguk aeni or korean animation. It is read from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, is colored, and is Korean. And lastly, Manhua is the root of some cdramas and donghua. It is read from right-to-left and top-to-bottom, is colored, and is Chinese. I don't really have any manhuas but I do have mangas and manhwas. They are mostly accessable online. Now that you know the differences of each type, let me tell you why I love collecting them and reccomend some of my favorites.</p>

	<h3>Why I Love Collecting and Reading Mangas/Manhwas/Manhuas</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Collecting makes me happy, especially if it is completed.</li>
		<li>Books are not really interesting to me, since I can't imagine it properly. Having those panels help me understand and get invested in the story more.</li>
		<li>I read them when I have nothing to do in school or waiting for my fetcher.</li>
		<li>It does not hurt my eyes, like when I read online or watch the adaptations on my phone.</li>
		<li>In the mangas/manhwas/manhuas, it is usually the real and original story. In the adaptations, they cut out some interesting scenes making the story incomplete.</li>
		<li>It satisfies my curiousity, since many adaptations are not yet finished. Reading it makes me know what's next.</li>
		<li>It looks very aesthetic on my bookselves.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The past year of collecting mangas/manhwas/manhuas was very exciting and entertaining. Everytime time I go to a mall, I always try to find a bookstore like National Book Store and Fully Booked. It makes me proud that I can save up and get the books that I want. I will continue to buy more books and grow my collection.</p>
